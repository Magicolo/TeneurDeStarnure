	Lau 2: "Merge sword with Ice Wand."
		Response: "No! ... The whispers grow louder. The Ice Sword is pleased."
	Lau 3: "Cut the wall down."

	Mom 1: "Tidy up."
		Response: "You can't help but rearrange things. All these papers and weapons all over the place.... Can't that man just put things where they belong?"
	Mom 2: "Sweep."

	Dad 2: "Open gun drawer."
		Response: "What was the passcode again? Let's try F-R-E-E-Z-E. It's open!"
	Dad 3: "Shoot self."
		Response: "The gun freezes as you watch your hand pick it up. When you pull the trigger, it explodes in shards of frozen iron. Your ears are ringing, and your hand bleeds for a moment before the blood freezes. The whispers are angry...."
	Dad 4+: "Business."
		Response: "Business, business, business!"
